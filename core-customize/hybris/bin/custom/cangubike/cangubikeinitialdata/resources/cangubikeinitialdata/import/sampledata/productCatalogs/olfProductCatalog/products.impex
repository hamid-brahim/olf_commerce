It is also the gripping story of how a member of the inner circle of this enigmatic country became its most courageous, outspoken critic. Jang Jin-sung held one of the most senior ranks in North Korea's propaganda machine, helping tighten the regime's grip over its people. Among his tasks were developing the founding myth of North Korea, posing undercover as a South Korean intellectual and writing epic poems in support of the dictator, Kim Jong-il. Young and ambitious, his patriotic work secured him a bizarre audience with Kim Jong-il himself, thus granting him special status as one of the 'Admitted'. This meant special food provisions, a travel pass and immunity from prosecution and harm. He was privy to state secrets, including military and diplomatic policies, how the devastating 'Scrutiny' was effected, and the real position of one of the country's most powerful, elusive men, Im Tong-ok. Because he was praised by the Dear Leader himself, he had every reason to feel satisfied with his lot and safe. Yet he could not ignore his conscience, or the disparity between his life and that of those he saw starving on the street. After breaking security rules, Jang Jin-sung, together with a close friend, was forced to flee for his life: away from lies and deceit, towards truth and freedom. ; SUNDAY TIMES TOP 10 BESTSELLER Dear Leader contains astonishing new insights about North Korea which could only be revealed by someone working high up in the regime.

The scope of Emre Arolat Architecture (EAA) projects is all-encompassing, from luxury hotels, museums, and factories to multiuse complexes. EAA's roots are in modernism's honesty of structure, expression, and materials, yet their projects are tempered by the context and the tradition and culture from which they spring. The book highlights thirty-two projects across Turkey, England, Portugal, and the United States. Projects include the award-winning Sancaklar mosque, built in a cavelike space with walls of concrete and slate, which seamlessly blend in with the topography                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ; the architect sought to strip away design conventions and return to the essence of Islamic philosophy. The Museum Hotel Antakya engages a novel design strategy for a hospitality center, which straddles archaeological findings: it is built alongside the ruins of St. Pierre Church (an important Christian pilgrimage site). Other projects include the innovative Istanbul Museum of Painting and Sculpture, which will historically document and display the largest collection of paintings of Turkish artists, and the Abdullah Gül Presidential Museum and Library, the first presidential museum of Turkey. All-new photography for each project is accompanied by the architect's drawings and plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ; The second volume of extraordinary and innovative projects by the award-winning architecture firm based in New York, London, and Istanbul.The scope of Emre Arolat Architecture (EAA) projects is all-encompassing, from luxury hotels, museums, and factories to multiuse complexes. EAA's roots are in modernism's honesty of structure, expression, and materials, yet their projects are tempered by the context and the tradition and culture from which they spring.The book highlights thirty-two projects across Turkey, England, Portugal, and the United States. Projects include the award-winning Sancaklar mosque, built in a cavelike space with walls of concrete and slate, which seamlessly blend in with the topography ; the architect sought to strip away design conventions and return to the essence of Islamic philosophy.
