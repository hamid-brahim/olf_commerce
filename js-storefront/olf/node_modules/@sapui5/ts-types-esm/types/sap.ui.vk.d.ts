     * Retry Mechanism: Requests to retrieve (download) a model from a remote server may not always be fulfilled.

     * keep on trying issuing new requests until the request is fulfilled or the specified `retryCount` is exceeded.

     *
     * **Events fired**: The download manager will not fire any events between subsequent attempts. For
     * each requested item there will be a single `itemSucceeded` or `itemFailed` event fired when the download
     * operation for that given item finishes.
     *
     * **Recoverable errors**: The following errors are considered recoverable:
     * 	 - Any kind of network error (e.g. due to temporary network outage). HTTP status code is expected to
     * 			be 0.
     * 	 - Responses with the following 4xx-5xx HTTP status codes:
     * 	408: Request Timeout
     * 	 - 425: Too Early (RFC 8470)
     * 	 - 429: Too Many Requests (RFC 6585)
